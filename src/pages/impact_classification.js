                <p>What is garbage sorting?</p>
                <p>Garbage classification is to put garbage into different categories, and make it into resources through sorting, transportation and recycling. It is roughly classified according to the composition and amount of waste generated, combined with the resource utilization and disposal methods of local waste. For example, Germany is generally divided into paper, glass, metal, plastic, etc.; Australia is generally divided into compostable garbage, recyclable garbage, and non-recyclable garbage; Japan is generally divided into combustible garbage and non-combustible garbage.</p>
                <p>The benefits and significance of garbage sorting</p>
                <p>1. Reduce environmental pollution</p>
                <p>Modern garbage contains chemical substances, some of which can cause people's morbidity to increase. If the garbage is disposed of through landfill or stacking, even if the garbage is buried far away from the living place and the corresponding isolation technology is adopted, it is difficult to prevent the penetration of harmful substances, which will enter the entire ecosystem along with the circulation of the earth. , Pollution of water sources and land, through plants or animals, will eventually affect people's health.</p>
                
                <p>2. Save land resources</p>
                <p>Garbage disposal methods such as landfill and garbage stacking occupy land resources, and landfills are all non-repairable places, that is, landfills cannot be re-used as living quarters. In addition, some substances in domestic garbage are not easily degraded, which makes the land seriously eroded. Sort garbage, separate recyclable and non-degradable materials, or set up a special recycling station for non-degradable materials. It will greatly reduce the pollution of garbage to the environment and the cost of garbage disposal.</p>

                <p>3. Utilization of renewable resources</p>
                <p>The generation of rubbish is due to the fact that people do not make good use of resources and discard the resources they do not use as rubbish. This way of discarding resources is impossible to estimate the loss of the entire ecosystem. Before garbage disposal, through garbage sorting and recycling, garbage can be turned into treasure. For example, recycling paper can protect forests and reduce the waste of forest resources; recycling bio-waste such as peels and vegetables can be used as green fertilizers to make the land more fertile .</p>

                <p>4. Improve people's values</p>
                <p>Garbage classification is the best solution and the best way to deal with garbage pollution. Garbage classification has become an inevitable path for the development of a country. Garbage classification can enable people to learn to save resources, use resources, develop good living habits, and improve personal quality. Although Melbourneâ€™s houses are equipped with various types of trash bins, many people still cannot distinguish the types of trash, which also brings difficulties to trash disposal</p>
