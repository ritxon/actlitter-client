                    <p>Littering will have a very bad impact on the environment. Whether it is littering on the street, in the trash can, or throwing the garbage in the square or park, or even directly next to the water. Garbage may be blown into or washed into rivers, woodlands, oceans, lakes and streams. The toxic or chemical substances in them will eventually pollute waterways, forest areas, soil or aquatic environment. For example, cigarette butts contain toxic substances such as arsenic, which can pollute soil and water. There is also a Pacific garbage dump related to ocean plastics on the earth, and marine life is also harmed. In addition, garbage will continuously emit odors and toxic chemical vapors, which will also cause air quality to decline.</p>

                    <p>1. Affect local tourism and urban environment.</p>
                    <p>The littered area looks rough and degrades the aesthetic value of the surrounding environment. Secondly, it will affect people's reputation for the city and local tourism, because the garbage on the ground will make the urban area and the roadside look disgusting. Melbourne is also a tourist resort, so keeping the city environment clean can not only improve the happiness of local residents, but also attract foreign tourists and enhance the tourism economy.</p>

                    <p>2. Increased possibility of fire</p>
                    <p>Cigarette butts are the easiest garbage that people throw away at will, but people usually ignore the potential threats caused by littering. It may cause fires due to dry air or igniting combustibles. Therefore, smokers should pay special attention to how to deal with the problem of cigarette butts and try to throw them in the cigarette extinction box. If there are only ordinary trash cans, make sure that the cigarette butts are completely extinguished before throwing them into the trash can. Don't throw away cigarette butts at will.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>3. Soil pollution</p>
                    <p>Soil pollution is one of the adverse effects of littering. Glass, metals, organics, etc. may contain harmful substances, such as batteries. Since batteries contain many harmful substances, if they are thrown away at will, they may seriously pollute the soil and damage the groundwater.</p>
                    <p>4. Water pollution</p>
                    <p>Littering can cause water pollution in many ways. When people throw rubbish directly into the water, rivers and lakes will be polluted. In addition, rubbish on the road will flow into the water due to wind and water power, causing pollution.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>5. Air pollution</p>
                    <p>People often burn garbage to remove it. However, during the combustion process, harmful substances contained in the garbage will enter the air, causing air pollution. Especially when burning plastics, many toxic gases and particulates emitted will have a negative impact on the human respiratory system.</p>
